         <h1 style="font-family:Avenir Next;">Making this website</h1>
         <br>
         <h3 style="font-family:Avenir Next;">This was a personal project.</h3>





          <h5 style="font-family:Avenir Next;">

          <p>At the beginning of lockdown I wanted to use the time freed up from commuting to create my online portfolio. The idea was to use the things I’d learnt at work so far (predominantly user research skills), learn new skills (such as how to use sketch, write content, and buy a domain) and to do all the stages of building a website by myself (but with the help of <i>many</i>). 
          </p><br>

          <p><b>What were the challenges?</b></p>
          <p>The main challenge was to get my head around how servers, domains, hosting services and things like bootstrap all connected together. In addition to this, I don’t have very much experience of writing code. I wanted to use this opportunity to understand a little bit more about how the internet works, and practise coding, whilst making something I can actually use to showcase my work.
          </p><br>

          <p><b>Who were the users and what were their needs?</b></p>
          <p>My users were myself and people who might want to work with me.<br>
<br>

           <i> "Misaki" as the user:</i><br>
           <li> I want to exhibit the best of my ux and illustration skills <br></li>
           <li>I want to get hired for my work<br></li>
            <li>I want to express myself <br></li>
            <br>
            <i>"People who might want to work with me" as the user:</i><br><br>
           <li> I need to be able to see the breadth of work misaki has done, but not everything.<br>
            <li>I need to know what, how and for who the work was done (and how- how much contribution there’s been)<br>
           <li> I need to see clear and concise messaging that misaki ticks off the criteria (key words)<br>
            <li>I need to see she can tell a story about the work she has done.<br>
            
            </p>
            <div class="container pt-5">


            <h3 style="font-family:Avenir Next;">What I did</h3>
          <p><b>1. I started with some desk research</b></p>
          <p>I looked at portfolio websites of various people, from facebook to design agencies, to government and NHSD. There’s so many ways of presenting oneself, and some were incredibly creative, some very aesthetic, some complex and others very simple. Once I had a wide look around, I found that there was no coherent theme that ran through all portfolios, so I started filtering the portfolios, nor really a particular structure that everyone stuck by. I thought about what kind of work I liked, which companies and organisations did them, then looked for their employees’ portfolios, and that gave me a clearer understanding of where I wanted to head with my own. 
          </p>

          <p><b>2. I then identified my users and their needs</b></p>
          <p>The users of my website would be me, and anyone who might want to work with me. As I knew what my needs were, I decided to concentrate on what the needs of someone who might be interested in working with me might be. So in true user centred design fashion, I conducted research to understand my users.</p>

          <p><b>3. Writing a research plan and discussion guide
          </b></p>
          <p>The focus of my research was to understand the process of someone looking to hire. I decided to take an informal approach to interviewing, so wrote 4 key questions I’d like to ask, and otherwise see where the conversation would go.
          </p>
          <p><i>A very brief discussion guide<br>
            Q1. How would you first go about looking someone up? What would be your first steps- walk me through it please.
            Q2. What is the most important thing you’d like to find out about a person?
            Q3. What would you like to see first, followed by what, and then what?
            Q4.When seeing UX work, what do you want to see?  And how?
            </i></p>
            <p><b>4. Recruiting and Interviews
              </b></p>
              <p>I recruited participants by contacting people I knew were senior design professionals doing work that I really liked. I talked to Clara, a service designer from GDS who planned and facilitated amazing training sessions, and Caroline, a consultant who has worked on making many forms better all over the public sector. Both of them were very generous with their time and I interviewed them over Teams, whilst taking handwritten notes.
            </p>


          <p><b>5. Analysis</b></p>
          <p>From my notes, I created bullet points of things Clara and Caroline said that related to content, and those that related to presentation. In the right column, you can see the top priority points, which were things both Clara and Caroline both mentioned. Followed by lower priority things that were still important. From this, I wrote up my user needs for someone who might want to hire me.

          </p><div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">
            <img src="pictures/graph.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"> 
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><b>6. Based on the user needs I now had, I hand drew a wire frame.</b></p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">
            <img src="pictures/hand.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"> 
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>


          <p><b>7. I then drafted up some words for my site.</b></p>
          <p>The user needs helped me to make sure I used the right words and put them in the right places.
          </p>

          <p><b>8. From there, I recreated the prototype on sketch. 
            </b></p>
            <p>I had never used sketch before, but I found it very easy to use. It was like a kinder version of Adobe Illustrator. I posted it on twitter with variations of the home page to see what people liked the most. Based upon popular opinion, I went for option C (which was also my favourite).</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm">
              <img src="pictures/visual.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"> 
              </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>At the same time, I also asked my manager Eric Lamarca and my previous design manager David Hunter to critique the visual prototype. Based upon their feedback, I tweaked it.</p>

            <p><b>9. Before building, I needed to understand (a little bit) how the internet works.</b></p>
            <p>I talked to two developers, Adam Chrimes, a front-end developer from NHSD, and Cristobel from hyperstudio to help me understand how “the internet” worked. I used netlify for my server, purchased my domain from google domains (because i felt the other sites looked dodgy although they’re probably fine..) and decided to use github as my repository hosting service.
            </p>

            <p><b>10. Then I built it. </b></p>
            <p>Once I was happy with the visual prototype, and had my domains and servers etc in place, I started building my website using bootstrap. It took a long time, and part way through I found I had made the website only compatible with desktop, so had to redo it all (I now understand why people told me to use grids rather than tables). I’ve found that time literally melts away, and it was frustrating, but also very therapeutic!
            </p>
            <p><b>Usability testing</b></p>
            <p>I used twitter to ask whether anyone would be willing to spare 30 minutes to usability test my website for me. </p>
  
            <h3 style="font-family:Avenir Next;">Outcome: You, looking at this site now :)</h3>
